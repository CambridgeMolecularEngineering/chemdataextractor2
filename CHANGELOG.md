# Change Log

## [v2.0](https://github.com/mcs07/ChemDataExtractor/releases/tag/v2.0) (2019-09-xx)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/mcs07/ChemDataExtractor/compare/...)

**Implemented enhancements:**

 - New model structure changed so that the Compound class is no longer at the root of all properties
 - Hierarchy changed so that documents own models, not parsers, so that the user doesnâ€™t need to remember to pass in all the correct parsers.
 - Quantity based models, allowing for easy detection of units and values. Also allows for better comparisons of models.
 - Completely new table parsing routine with the incorporation of TableDataExtractor. This returns a more structured form for tables without any user input.
 - Automatically generated parsers based on the dimensional information of properties.
 - Forward looking Interdependency Resolution for detecting definitions of specifier terms and chemical names.
 - Improved Interdendency Resolution to account for more complex models.
 - Snowball integration where Snowball parsers can be used seamlessly alongside rule-based parsers.
 - Improved performance, with parsing up to 2x faster in real-world usage.
 - The incorporation of an evaluation package for measuring the performance of CDE.
 - Improved tokenisation when using new quantity based models.
 - Improved documentation, including a migration guide for users coming from older versions.
