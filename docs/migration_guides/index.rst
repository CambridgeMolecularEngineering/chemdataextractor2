Migrating
=============================================

Whilst the scale differs depending on the release, some changes will need to be made to your code when moving to a new release of ChemDataExtractor so that you can take advantage of the new features. Some changes may even be required as APIs are deprecated or removed. To try and make this process smoother, there are migration guides for each new version of ChemDataExtractor here. These go slightly more in depth than the changelog, with advice for how to structure your code to best take advantage of any new additions.
