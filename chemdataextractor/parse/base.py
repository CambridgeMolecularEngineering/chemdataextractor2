    Optional :class:`~chemdataextractor.parse.elements.BaseParserElement` instance.
    All sentences are run through this before the full root phrase is applied to the
    sentence. If nothing is found for this phrase, the sentence will not go through
    the full root phrase. This is done for performance reasons, and if not set,
    ChemDataExtractor will perform as it did in previous versions. If this phrase is
    set to an appropriate value, it can help ChemDataExtractor perform at up to 2x
    its previous speed.

    To ensure that this works as intended, the :class:`~chemdataextractor.parse.elements.BaseParserElement`
    should be a simple parse rule (substantially simpler than the :class:`~chemdataextractor.parse.base.BaseParser.root`)
    that takes little time to process.
