    Used for extracting units with these dimensions.
    It is of type dictionary{:class:`chemdataextractor.parse.element` : :class:`~chemdataextractor.model.units.unit.Unit` or :class:`None`}.

    An :class:`~chemdataextractor.parse.element` is the key for :class:`None` when an element is needed for autoparsing
    to work correctly, but one does not want to take account of this when extracting a unit from a merged string.

    An example of this is °C, which is always split into two tokens, so we need to be able to capture ° and C
    separately using elements from the :attr:`units_dict`, but we do not want this to affect :meth:`~chemdataextractor.parse.base.BaseParser.extract_units`,
    to which the single string '°C' is passed in. As a solution, we have the following :attr:`units_dict`::

        units_dict = {R('°?(((K|k)elvin(s)?)|K)\.?', group=0): Kelvin,
              R('(°C|((C|c)elsius))\.?', group=0): Celsius,

    Operators are implemented so that composite dimensions can be created easily
