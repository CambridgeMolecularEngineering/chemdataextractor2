An early study of the A = Ba and M′ = Re members by Sleight and collaborators8 revealed that several members of the series ( M = Mn , Fe , Ni ) are ferrimagnetic.9 Sr2FeReO6,2 Ba2FeReO63,9 and name_1 are unique in that they are both metallic and ferrimagnetic , Sr2CrReO6 having an exceptionally large specifier_1 of value_1  units_1. with confidence score 1.0

For name_1 the specifier_1 decreases from value_1  units_1 to value_2  units_2as illustrated in Fig. 10 . with confidence score 1.0

 name_1 is a ferromagnetic transition metal exhibiting a high specifier_1 of value_1  units_1( ferromagnetic – paramagnetic transition ) and a high saturation magnetization ( 1422 emu cm−3 ) at room temperature.2 The technological applications of Co nanoparticles in the field of ultrahigh - density data recording and data storage are well documented in the literature.1 Recently , Co has also been used in MRI agents,3 a field which has primarily been dominated by iron oxides ( Fe3O4 ) because of their stability and biocompatibility albeit the oxides show much less saturation magnetization ( 84 emu cm−3)4 in comparison to cobalt . with confidence score 1.0

The DC susceptibility curves of the name_1 nanocrystals show a transition temperature specifier_1 at around value_1  units_1( estimated from the inflection point of the curves ) and a thermal irreversibility below Tir = 14 K . with confidence score 1.0

The much smaller value of TB compared to the specifier_1 ( value_1  units_1 ) of bulk name_1suggests that the thickness of the Ni shell is very small . with confidence score 1.0

 name_1 is ferromagnetic with a specifier_1 of value_1  units_1and Co9S8 is antiferromagnetic with a Néel temperature above the decomposition temperature.28 The magnetic susceptibility of Ni3S2 was found to be temperature - independent , which is consistent with Pauli paramagnetism . with confidence score 1.0

 name_1 is probably the most studied half metal because of it high specifier_1 ( ∼ value_1  units_1) , which is critical for device applications.120 Moreover , the lack of toxicity in Fe3O4 also promises applications in medical and biological areas , such as drug delivery and magnetic resonance imaging.121 Previously , Fe3O4 nanowires,120,122nanotubes,123,124 and core / shell nanowires125,126 have been synthesized , and their magneto - transport properties were studied . with confidence score 1.0

As another notable spintronic material , name_1 has a high spin polarization ( > 95 % )118 and a specifier_1 of value_1  units_1. with confidence score 1.0

Multiferroic materials show simultaneous ferroelectric and magnetic orders , promising novel applications.142 Among them , name_1 ( BFO ) has received the most attention , due to its high ferroelectric specifier_1 ( ∼ value_1  units_1) and the AFM Neel temperature ( ∼ 647 K ) . with confidence score 1.0
